# Sentiment Analysis
A python project that uses natural language processing techniques to analyze social media or news sentiment related to cryptocurrencies:


Please note that you have the required libraries ```requests```, ```bs4```, ```textblob``` installed before running the code. You can install them using the following commands;
```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install textblob
```

__1. Data Retrieval:__

 - ```fetch_data_from_api``` method fetches data from a specified API using the ```requests``` library and stores it in the ```self.data``` list.
 - ```scrape_data_from_website``` method scrapes data from a specified website using the ```requests``` and ```BeautifulSoup``` libraries and stores it in the ```self.data``` list.
   
__2. Sentiment Analysis:__

 - ```analyze_sentiment``` method performs sentiment analysis on each item in the ```self.data``` list using the ```TextBlob``` library.
 - Sentiment scores are calculated for each item and stored in the ```sentiment_scores``` list.
 - The sentiment analysis results are printed for each item, and an overall sentiment score is calculated based on the average sentiment scores.


To use this code: you need to replace the placeholder code in the ```fetch_data_from_api``` and ```scrape_data_from_website``` methods with the actual logic to retrieve and extract data from the API or website of your choice. Additionally, you may need to customize the sentiment analysis process based on your specific requirements and the structure of your data.
